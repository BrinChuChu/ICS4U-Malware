# ICS4U-Trojan

This repository is a semester long project where I research and learn how to make malware with Python. 

More specifically, a trojan horse, a type of malware that diguises itself as something legitimate, but in reality, it is conducting malicous activity.

# To-Do List:

- Construct an actual useful app (Will be posted on another repo without malware)
- Ruin the app by creating malware 
- Make malware collect information from user (keylogging?)
- Be hidden at first
- Make malware make copies of itself
- Creating certain triggers will cause malware to worsen
- Unclosable popups
- Funny adware
- Don't accidentally infect myself
- Try encrypt all files and ask for money in exchange for a key using trigger with cryptography
- Go crazy mode
- Backdoor to stop malware
- Send all info to a server

# Bonus Goals

- Reproducable?? (probably a bad idea.)
